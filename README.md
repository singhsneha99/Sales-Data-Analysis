# Sales Data Analysis

This project performs exploratory data analysis on a retail company's sales dataset to derive insights.

## Data
The data comes from a CSV file containing 1000 rows of transactional sales data with the following columns:

- Invoice ID
- Branch 
- City
- Customer Type
- Gender
- Product Line
- Unit Price
- Quantity
- Tax
- Total
- Date
- Time
- Payment Method
- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
- Gross Margin Percentage
- Gross Income
- Rating

## Analysis
The Jupyter notebook performs the following analyses on the data:

- Explores distribution of categorical variables using value_counts()
- Visualizes distribution of numerical variables like Total Sales using histograms
- Creates a correlation matrix heatmap to identify relationships
- Generates visualizations like line charts, bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, and box plots to understand sales patterns across multiple dimensions like time, product, branch, customer attributes etc.

## Visualizations:

- Tracks total sales over time using line chart
- Analyzes sales by branch and product line via stacked bar chart
- Checks distribution of customer types using pie chart
- Compares sales across product lines through bar chart
- Visualizes sales by gender with stacked bar chart
- Plots ratings distribution with histogram
- Checks payment method usage using pie chart
- Finds top selling products with horizontal bar chart
- Compares margin percentage across branches using bar plot
- Tracks monthly sales trend using line chart
- Identifies pricing patterns with quantity scatter plot
- Compares ratings by customer type using box plot

## Usage
To use this analysis, simply run the Jupyter notebook after installing the required libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn). The visualizations and distribution analyses will provide insights into the company's sales performance. Additional statistical tests or machine learning models can also be applied to support business decisions.
